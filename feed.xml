Just played around with the German Union Catalogue of Serails (ZDB) \@DNB_Aktuelles Nice graphs, maps and data. #journals #linkeddata #authorityfiles pic.twitter.com/f0qVtAWA5d&mdash; Dr. Anne Klammt (\@archaeoklammt) November 30, 2021 Part of the German National Library (Deutsche Nationalbibliothek, DNB), the website looks great and provides a lot of data-driven functionality, such as maps and timelines of holdings. The display language of the website itself, though not the bibliographic data, can be toggled between German and English. This is a welcome nod to international users and will certainly increase the visibility of this important portal. However, it must be noted that unfortunately the dataset of bibliographic data is not as accessible as the interface. Languages written in scripts other than Latin are provided in a variety of inconsistent transcriptions into Latin script for mostly historical technical reasons. This is not the fault of ZDB per se but it will prevent communities from the Global South from finding and accessing their own cultural heritage, which for various reasons are held by institutions in the Global North. This is especially relevant for Arabic material, as I will elaborate in the section on transliterations below. On the upside, however, ZDB supports historical political entities, such as the Ottoman Empire, for facetted browsing, which I have not yet seen in other library catalogues. Crucially, ZDB also provides...]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mapping Arabic periodical titles between 1799 and 1929</title><link href="https://tillgrallert.github.io/blog/2021/04/28/mapping-arabic-periodical-titles-between-1799-and-1929/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mapping Arabic periodical titles between 1799 and 1929"/><published>2021-04-28T21:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-04-28T21:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://tillgrallert.github.io/blog/2021/04/28/mapping-arabic-periodical-titles-between-1799-and-1929</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://tillgrallert.github.io/blog/2021/04/28/mapping-arabic-periodical-titles-between-1799-and-1929/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A tutorial for mapping with R - To celebrate this year’s Day of DH (#DayOfDH20201), I want to share this draft tutorial for mapping multilingual bibliographic data sets with R. NOTES This is a draft and I appreciate any comments, questions etc. using hypothes.is. This website is generated using the default GitHub pages Jekyll workflow, which does not support a citeproc plugin. The few references are, therefore, currently not formatted. The resulting maps have been published in their own repository. Introduction Large bibliographic dataset such as the one compiled by Project Jarāʾid (Mestyan, Grallert, and et al. 2020), which comprises information on more than 3300 periodical titles, are far too large and unwieldy for manual analysis. One wants to use descriptive statistics and visualisations for a first exploration of the data set, which can then guide further scrutiny and create new research questions. Basic information for each periodical in the Project Jarāʾid data set (with very few exceptions) include the date of the first publication as well as a publication location and additional languages beyond Arabic for bi- or even multilingual periodicals. Such a data set lends itself to mapping in order to see the distribution of the number of periodical titles per location for a certain period and region. In order to visualise change over time, one will want to animate the map in some way, just as the ones below: These GIFs combine multiple maps into a single animation and show the geographic distribution of new periodical titles in rolling periods of different length (year...]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Annual report: OpenArabicPE in 2019</title><link href="https://tillgrallert.github.io/blog/2020/01/07/annual-report-openarabicpe-in-2019/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Annual report: OpenArabicPE in 2019"/><published>2020-01-07T22:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-01-07T22:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://tillgrallert.github.io/blog/2020/01/07/annual-report-openarabicpe-in-2019</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://tillgrallert.github.io/blog/2020/01/07/annual-report-openarabicpe-in-2019/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The work on digital scholarly editions (DSE) of late Ottoman Arabic periodicals continued within the framework of OpenArabicPE (see annual report 2017). I added a number of periodicals to the existing editions of Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī’s al-Muqtabas (Damascus and Cairo, 1906–18) and ʿAbd al-Qādir al-Iskandarānī’s al-Ḥaqāʾiq (Damascus, 1910–12) following the principles and workflows established over the last years. These are: Anastās Mārī al-Karmalī’s monthly journal Lughat al-ʿArab (Baghdad, 1911–14), Anṭūn al-Jumayyil’s monthly journal al-Zuhūr (Cairo, 1910–1913) and Abd Allāh Nadīm al-Idrīsī’s weekly journal al-Ustādh (Cairo, 1892–1893). The ability to quickly add and release a number of periodicals with full text and digital facsimiles was helped by the anonymous transcribers at al-Maktaba al-Shāmila, who reproduced the page breaks as found in the printed originals that allow us to quickly link the text to the facsimile. This is very different from both al-Muqtabas and al-Ḥaqāʾiq for which we had to add each of the 8000+ page breaks manually. Finally, I worked on a facsimile edition with transcriptions of article titles and bylines of Jirjī Niqūlā Bāz’s al-Ḥasnāʾ (Beirut, 1909–11). In the last report, I mentioned the importance of authorship attribution for the vast majority of anonymous articles if one wants to analyse the (social) network of authors and texts that form the ideosphere of the Arabic press in the Eastern Mediterranean. The, often implicit and accepted, hypothesis is that a periodical’s editors authored all articles for which they did not provide a meaningful byline. There are two issues with this hypothesis: first,...]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Annual report: OpenArabicPE in 2018</title><link href="https://tillgrallert.github.io/blog/2019/01/14/annual-report-openarabicpe-in-2018/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Annual report: OpenArabicPE in 2018"/><published>2019-01-14T22:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-01-14T22:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://tillgrallert.github.io/blog/2019/01/14/annual-report-openarabicpe-in-2018</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://tillgrallert.github.io/blog/2019/01/14/annual-report-openarabicpe-in-2018/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The work on the digital editions of Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī’s journal al-Muqtabas (Damascus and Cairo, 1906–18) and ʿAbd al-Qādir al-Iskandarānī’s journal al-Ḥaqāʾiq (Damascus, 1910–12) continued within the framework of OpenArabicPE. Contributions from our interns Manzi Tanna-Händel, Xaver Kretzschmar, Klara Mayer, Tobias Sick and Hans Magne Jaatun allowed us to release a further four volumes. Readers can find a project description in the last annual report and I will focus here on the first foray into the analysis of our corpus. One of the driving research questions behind OpenArabicPE focusses on reconstructing the ideosphere of the late Ottoman and early Arabic press through establishing networks of authors and texts published and referenced in the periodicals. With regards to al-Muqtabas and al-Ḥaqāʾiq, we ask: who published what in late Ottoman Damascus? As well as, what was read in late Ottoman Damascus? Any sort of meaningful computational analysis of the global connections between authors, texts, and periodicals as a venue for publication and review requires access to reliable standardised bibliographic metadata as a bare minimum. Unfortunately, such data is practically non-existant on the article level beyond our OpenArabicPE corpus. The situation is only marginally better on the issue level. Available metadata is not commonly provided in a standard-compliant and machine-actionable format. But even then, the vast majority of articles would remain outside our analytical scopes. Many publishers did not provide (meaningful) bylines and the majority articles in journals and newspapers from Beirut, Cairo or Damascus did not credit their authors (c.f. Table).

Basic slides are available <a href="https://tillgrallert.github.io/slides/2017-dhi-beirut/">here</a> and <a href="https://tillgrallert.github.io/slides/2017-dhad/">here</a>.</p> <h1 id="intro">Intro</h1> <p>In the world of (academic) publishing, large aggregators and indexers have turned into and acquired publishing presses and generate obscene profits by charging the public (every tax-payer worldwide) multiple times over. First by charging the predominantly publicly-funded academic for publishing the results of her publicly-funded research and by enforcing a culture of <em>pro bono</em> labour among academic reviewers and editors; second by selling this content to equally predominantly publicly-funded libraries, which then increasingly demand access fees from members of the public, who want to access their collections; and third by offloading the cost of long-term preservation to, again, publicly-funded institutions. This system not only created a hierarchy of academics and institutions in the relatively well-off “West”—two classes divided by their ability to pay for being published and accessing publications (their own and others). It also increasingly prevents anybody outside western academia from accessing cutting-edge research and participating in intellectual discourse.</p> <p>One of the opportunities afforded by the <em>digital humanities</em> and the stated goal of this endeavour is to remove the middlemen—be they technical or entrepreneurial—between authors, readers, and the library-cum-archive. There are two main obstacles to this aim:</p> <ol> <li>copyright laws and</li> <li>the alienation of us, authors and academics, from the means of production.</li> </ol> <p>We will not be able to change copyright legislation and the vested business interests in sustaining and expanding the regime of profit-generating copy and distribution rights in the foreseeable future, but we can all provide our knowledge under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">creative commons licence</a>. In order to do so, we need to re-claim the means of production. We argue that by doing so the main argument for restrictive copyright—namely, the provision of allegedly expensive services such as quality control and metadata curation—collapses. By the time of writing, printing costs and the global distribution of heavy and voluminous books are already negligible as the main avenue of scholarly publication, the journal, has already moved to digital online publication.</p> <h1 id="principles">Principles</h1> <p>The main principles in our effort to (re)claim the means of production are: accessibility, simplicity, sustainability, and credibility. They shall pertain both to the intellectual endeavour and to the tools employed.</p> <ol> <li><em>Accessibility</em>. Accessible means first of all free and open to use and re-purpose for all that have the technical ability to do. Therefore we will have to forfeit all proprietary software and formats. From the imperative of openness and accessibility derive the second and third principles:</li> <li><em>Simplicity</em>: apart from the necessity to be able read and write in a specific human language, there should be as few tools, hardware and software requirements as possible. Ideally everything should work on ten-year old hardware and nothing but the software packaged with the operating system—or even better: the core technologies should work without a computer.</li> <li><em>Sustainability</em>: only simple systems adhering to widely accepted standards can be sustained with minimal / reasonable effort.</li> <li><em>Credibility</em>: Credibility is at the core of scholarly production. In addition to transparency as to the sources, methodology, and tools used, authorship needs to be ascertained and acknowledged as the main tool of scholarly quality control.</li> </ol> <h1 id="tools--formats">Tools / formats</h1> <h2 id="1-writing">1. Writing</h2> <p>Looking at the most broadly-employed software in academic contexts and beyond, Microsoft’s Word, a piece of bloated and expensive proprietary software, what are the functions we need to replace?</p> <h3 id="1-composition--authoring">1. composition / authoring</h3> <p>To avoid overtly complex software and proprietary formats, form and content must be separated. Structural / semantic and representational information as well as metadata must be embedded in the text itself in order to be inseparable. We suggest using plain text with rudimentary markup following the conventions of MarkDown and a short block of metadata written in Yaml as the format of choice.</p> <ul> <li><em>Format</em>: plain text. At their core, all files are simple strings of letters. In the case of plain text files (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TXT</code>), this string of letters happens to be human readable. Plain text has been with us since the early days of computing and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TXT</code> files could be viewed and edited with 1980s hard- and software. We can therefore assume that this basic format will remain accessible for the years to come.</li> <li><em>Syntax</em>: <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">MarkDown</a> and its derivatives provide a simple but formal way of providing structural (headings, lists, notes, block quotes etc.) and formating (italics, bold) information that is both human and machine readable. Think of it as the old way of underlining a line of text on a type-writer to indicate a heading.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></li> <li><em>Metadata</em>: <a href="http://yaml.org/">Yaml (Yaml ain’t markup language)</a> provides a simple way of including structured metadata (data about data) at the beginning of a text file recording information on authors, title, date etc..</li> <li><em>Tools</em>: All major operating systems come with basic text editors sufficient for reading and editing plain text files (“Notepad” on Windows, “TextEdit” on Mac{» comment on Linux«}). However, some additional features, such as syntax highlighting and basic customisation of the writing interface (you have to look at it for substantial periods of time), will significantly enhance the writing experience. <ul> <li><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> (Windows, Mac, Linux)</li> <li><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">NotePad++</a> (Windows only)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id="2-ascertaining-authorship-version-control-and-archiving">2. ascertaining authorship, version control, and archiving</h3> <p>Writing is a process and subject to change. We need to be able to try out different structures and formulations and, more often than one would like to, we discover that yesterday’s deletions would have been worth keeping. Not to mention an external editor or collaborators that quickly make any approach involving ever-longer file names futile (we all have our folders full of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">text.docx</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">text-new-version.docx</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">text-new-version-2004-01-01.docx</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">text-new-version-2004-01-01-comments-by-tg-2.docx</code> etc.).</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://git-scm.com/"><em>git</em></a>: git is an open <em>version control system</em> (vcs) that works with any file type.

Once a change has been committed to a GitHub repository, authors have a public proof of their authorship with a unique identifier that can be referenced. In addition, the repository forms a redundant online back-up of your work. <ul> <li><em>ssh</em> (secure shell): in order to communicate with a server without a local client software, some knowledge of ssh is necessary. To avoid this, one can use any of the numerous GitHub clients.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></li> </ul> </li> <li><a href="https://zenodo.org/"><em>Zenodo</em></a>: Zenodo is an open science platform developed and operated by CERN.

Think about and provide a licence</h3> <p>{»mention copyright«}</p> <p>A licence is formal agreement that specifies the rights and duties of both the <em>licensor</em> (e.g. us as authors) and the <em>licencee</em> (e.g. us as readers). Its most important purpose within our discussion is to assure the readers of our texts of their rights to read, copy, and cite them. An open licence might for instance allow reproduction of the text but might prohibit charging for accessing the reproduction.</p> <p>Formulating one’s own licence text is a challenge and one might not be familiar enough with the necessary “legalese” to write a text readers can rely on. In consequence we suggest looking at established licences and having made a case for open access {»open science, open knowledge etc.«}, we suggest to start with <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">creative commons licences</a>.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p> <h3 id="3-publish--distribute-the-content">3. Publish / distribute the content</h3> <p>Websites of more than a single page of text tend to be technically complex and require an infrastructure of data storage, internet connections, web addresses, some <em>content management system</em> (cms), and databases that rarely come for free and without the need of maintenance. In addition, contemporary dynamic websites are almost impossible to archive or download in their entirety. To reduce complexity and the number of technologies, we suggest using static, self-contained websites without a content management system and no database.</p> <ul> <li><em>jekyll</em>: <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is currently one of the most popular open tools to generate “dynamic” static, self-contained websites from plain text files containing MarkDown and Yaml, using nothing but <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HTML</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CSS</code> and nested files and folders. These can either be hosted online or distributed on a USB key.</li> <li><em>GitHub pages</em>: There are, of course, plenty of open, free or commercial providers to host your website. But having already signed up to GitHub and keeping all our texts in a GitHub repository, it is worthwhile to look at <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a>, which provide free hosting of version-controlled content and supports jekyll out of the box. This means one can directly publish Markdown-formatted plain text files through GitHub pages and jekyll.</li> </ul> <h1 id="challenges">Challenges:</h1> <p>How to deal with sensitive data / material, that should not be publicly accessible, such as ethnographic field notes?</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://openpgp.org/">OpenPGP</a>: PGP stands for “pretty good privacy” and is widely used for encrypting emails.

Disclaimer 2: I am teaching short workshops on some of the ideas outlined in this post at Digital Humanities Institute - Beirut on 10 March 2017 and at DH Abu Dhabi on 10 April 2017. Basic slides are available here and here. Intro In the world of (academic) publishing, large aggregators and indexers have turned into and acquired publishing presses and generate obscene profits by charging the public (every tax-payer worldwide) multiple times over. First by charging the predominantly publicly-funded academic for publishing the results of her publicly-funded research and by enforcing a culture of pro bono labour among academic reviewers and editors; second by selling this content to equally predominantly publicly-funded libraries, which then increasingly demand access fees from members of the public, who want to access their collections; and third by offloading the cost of long-term preservation to, again, publicly-funded institutions. This system not only created a hierarchy of academics and institutions in the relatively well-off “West”—two classes divided by their ability to pay for being published and accessing publications (their own and others). It also increasingly prevents anybody outside western academia from accessing cutting-edge research and participating in intellectual discourse.
