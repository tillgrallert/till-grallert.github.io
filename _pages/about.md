I am a social and media historian of the Arabic-speaking Eastern Mediterranean from the 19th century to the present. I lead the [NFDI4Memory](https://www.4memory.de)'s *Methods Innovation Lab* at the Department of History, [Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin](https://hu-berlin.de) since 2023. Here, we work at establishing the necessary data culture for the age of digitality through fostering digital and computational tool literacy and experiment as a hermeneutical approach for the humanities.

I hold a PhD in history from [Freie Universität Berlin](https://www.bgsmcs.fu-berlin.de/) (2014) and an MA from the [School of Oriental and African Studies](http://soas.ac.uk) (SOAS, 2008), University of London.  My research and teaching are concerned with the consequences of the fundamental epistemic change towards the digital for societies of the Global South and the social and entangled histories of technologies and infrastructures in the predominantly Arabic-speaking Eastern Mediterranean since the late 18th century: from streets, tramways and the telegraph to printing and the periodical press, to more recent new media and platforms of the digital. 

Influenced by the *spatial turn*, a *history from below* and *quotidian history*, I initially asked "to whom belong the streets?" in my doctoral work, which I completed with a thesis on "Property, Propriety, and Appropriation: The Production of Public Space in Late Ottoman Damascus, 1875--1914". This trajectory continued with postdoctoral research at the [Orient-Institut Beirut](https://www.orient-institut.org/), Lebanon, on the genealogy of food riots as a repertoire of contention and the gendered dimension of contentious actions in the Eastern Mediterranean. 

Deeply involved in digital humanities work as a practicioner, teacher, and consultant and grounded in my experiences with the specific affordances of the Global South for DH and computational humanities as a researcher predominantly living in Lebanon between 2011 and 2021, my digital and computational work provides a theory-driven, practical critique of the epistemic violence of the post-digital moment and the neocolonial hegemony of the anglophone West. I address these issues as co-convenor of working groups on Multilingual DH within [ADHO]() and [DHd](https://www.multilingualdh.de/) and in multiple projects:

1. a framework for bootstrapped scholarly editions outside the global north ("Open Arabic Periodical Editions", [OpenArabicPE](https://openarabicpe.github.io/)); 
2. a crowd-sourced union list of all Arabic periodicals published globally before 1930 ([Jarāʾid](https://projectjaraid.github.io/)); 
3. and building minimal infrastructures of multi-layered annotation to digitised cultural artefacts as a space for inherently local narratives (al-Iwan: Disorienting Orientalism). 

As such my work is closely related to developments in code and platform studies as well as global, decolonial, and critical DH. 

Finally, in the realm of periodical studies, I am interested in the socio-linguistics of early Arabic newspapers and the specifics of historical periodical production. The computational investigation of the ideoscape of early Arabic periodicals and at scale, has been supported by a Marie Skłodowska-Curie postdoctoral fellowship.
