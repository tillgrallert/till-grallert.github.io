We discuss the need for such a data set, which originated with scholarly crowd-sourcing project Jar{\=a}ʾid and comprises information on more than 3000 periodicals, about 2700 editors, and almost 350 holding institutions, the weaknesses of our original approach, and how the move to Wikidata, the largest public and open knowledge graph, addresses them. We demonstrate how Wikidata also satisfies the two predominant use cases of this data set not currently served by available library and discovery systems. Finally, we show how the move to Wikidata generates continuous engagement with wider Wikimedia communities and demonstrate the reusability of our approach with a second data set of periodicals from the Ottoman Empire.},

  abstract = {This paper re-evaluates the history of Ottoman censorship through the lens of conceptual history, focusing on how the periodical press of Damascus and Beirut reported incidents of violence between 1875 and 1914. I argue that well into the twentieth century, the Ottoman state had insufficient power to comprehensively enforce censorship. Instead, the press and the state were interdependent and shared the belief in a modernising project with the ever-expanding state at its core. The press largely understood its role as serving society as it moved along this path to progress and prosperity. Thus, we encounter deeply entrenched editorial tactics, epitomised by the reference to generic "incidents," to deal with the tension between violence as a quotidian phenomenon and its very occurrence being perceived as a fundamental challenge to the social contract. Analysing the tactics used to delegitimise acts of violence and their perpetrators, the paper establishes an ontology and a topography of the discourse on violence in the late Ottoman Eastern Mediterranean.},

This modular framework of a basic data model, SPARQL queries, bash scripts, and a prototypical web interface builds upon the well-established and open infrastructures of Wikimedia, GitLab, and Zenodo for creating, maintaining, sharing, curating, and archiving linked open data. We demonstrate the feasibility of this framework by introducing our concrete implementation of a tool registry for digital humanities, initially repurposing data from existing silos, such as TAPoR and the SSH Open Marketplace, and retaining the established TaDiRAH classification scheme while being open to communal editing in every aspect.},

  abstract = {Named entity recognition (NER) is a core task for historical research in automatically establishing all references to people, places, events and the like. Yet, do to the high linguistic and genre diversity of sources, only limited canonisation of spellings, the level of required historical domain knowledge, and the scarcity of annotated training data, established approaches to natural language processing (NLP) have been both extremely expensive and yielded only unsatisfactory results in terms of recall and precision. Our paper introduces a new approach. We demonstrate how readily-available, state-of-the-art LLMs significantly outperform two leading NLP frameworks, spaCy and flair, for NER in historical documents by seven to twentytwo percent higher F1-Scores. Our ablation study shows how providing historical context to the task and a bit of persona modelling that turns focus away from a purely linguistic approach are core to a successful prompting strategy. We also demonstrate that, contrary to our expectations, providing increasing numbers of examples in few-shot approaches does not improve recall or precision below a threshold of 16-shot. In consequence, our approach democratises access to NER for all historians by removing the barrier of scripting languages and computational skills required for established NLP tools and instead leveraging natural language prompts and consumer-grade tools and frontends.},

  abstract = {"Harkening back to the "big tent" metaphor (e.g. Terras 2013) which characterized debates about the inclusivity of DH ten years ago, the topic of 'openness' in the conference theme invites associations of 'blue skies', endless horizons, and the sense that everything is possible -- in terms of participation, dissemination and objects of observation. This notion is complicated by several issues that discourses of cultural criticism have identified in the Digital Humanities in recent years (although they are not exclusive to the field): Among them monolingualism (Fiormonte 2021), a heritage of colonialism (Risam 2019) and gender imbalance (Gao et al. 2022, 330), to name but a few. Supposing that there is something to be learned from shifting the gaze towards these "borderlands" (Earhart 2018) of attention, the panel will interrogate the theme of the conference and probe the boundaries of its 'openness' against this backdrop of socio-economic, political and infrastructural inequalities."

  abstract = {From the mid-nineteenth century onward, Arabic periodicals were the first mass-medium of South West Asia and North Africa (SWANA) and formed an increasingly globalised public sphere. Consequently, they attract increasingly scholarly attention. However, most articles up until at least World War I were published without a proper byline, commonly causing scholars to conflate owners-cum-editors with their journals. This paper computationally addresses the question of authorship through stylometric authorship attribution applied to data sets derived from digital corpora of journals published in Baghdad (Lughat al-ʿArab), Cairo (al-Zuh{\=u}r, alMuqtabas), and Damascus (al-Muqtabas, al-{\d H}aq{\=a}ʾiq) between 1906 and 1918. It demonstrates, firstly, that titles were stylistically sufficiently different to identify a distinctive authorial voice for each periodical. Secondly, it shows that individual anonymous articles cannot be reduced to a single author for each journal and that ownerscum-editors should not be considered strong candidates for their authorship. Thirdly, it also rejects owners-cumeditors as strong candidates for the bulk of anonymous texts originally published in short chunks as part of news sections, announcements, miscellanea etc. Finally, this paper rejects all known authors in our corpus as potential editors thus necessitating further, non-computational research.},
