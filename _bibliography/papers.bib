  abstract = {This paper documents the contribution of comprehensive bibliographic data on all Arabic periodicals published worldwide until 1930 to Wikidata. We discuss the need for such a data set, which originated with scholarly crowd-sourcing project Jarāʾid and comprises information on more than 3000 periodicals, about 2700 editors, and almost 350 holding institutions, the weaknesses of our original approach, and how the move to Wikidata, the largest public and open knowledge graph, addresses them. We demonstrate how Wikidata also satisfies the two predominant use cases of this data set not currently served by available library and discovery systems. Finally, we show how the move to Wikidata generates continuous engagement with wider Wikimedia communities and demonstrate the reusability of our approach with a second data set of periodicals from the Ottoman Empire.},

  abstract= {This paper re-evaluates the history of Ottoman censorship through the lens of conceptual history, focusing on how the periodical press of Damascus and Beirut reported incidents of violence between 1875 and 1914. I argue that well into the twentieth century, the Ottoman state had insufficient power to comprehensively enforce censorship. Instead, the press and the state were interdependent and shared the belief in a modernising project with the ever-expanding state at its core. The press largely understood its role as serving society as it moved along this path to progress and prosperity. Thus, we encounter deeply entrenched editorial tactics, epitomised by the reference to generic “incidents”, to deal with the tension between violence as a quotidian phenomenon and its very occurrence being perceived as a fundamental challenge to the social contract. Analysing the tactics used to delegitimise acts of violence and their perpetrators, the paper establishes an ontology and a topography of the discourse on violence in the late Ottoman Eastern Mediterranean.}
